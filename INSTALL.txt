Building and Installing Oils
============================

Oils is a new Unix shell.  This file describes how to configure, build, and
install it from source code.

Quick Start
-----------

If you haven't already done so, extract the tarball:
 
    tar -x --gz < oil-for-unix-0.21.0.tar.gz
    cd oil-0.21.0

Either install as /usr/local/bin/osh:

    ./configure      # completes very quickly
    _build/oils.sh   # 30-60 seconds
    sudo ./install

or install as ~/bin/osh and the man page as ~/.local/share/man/man1/osh.1:

    ./configure --prefix ~ --datarootdir ~/.local/share
    _build/oils.sh
    ./install

The latter doesn't require root access, but it requires:

- ~/bin to be in your $PATH
- Pages under ~/.local/share/man to be found by 'man'.
  (See manpath or $MANPATH.)

NOTE: Out-of-tree builds are NOT currently supported, so you have to be in the
oils-for-unix-0.21.0 directory.

Smoke Test
----------

OSH behaves like a POSIX shell:

    $ osh -c 'echo hi'
    hi

This parses and prints a syntax tree for the 'configure' script.

    osh -n configure

More Documentation
------------------

Every release has a home page with links, e.g.

    https://oilshell.org/release/0.21.0/

System Requirements
-------------------

You only need:

  - A C++11 compiler
    - with libc and libstdc++
  - A POSIX shell to invoke _build/oils.sh

Optional:

  - GNU readline library, for interactive features
    (https://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html)

Debian/Ubuntu and derivatives:

    sudo apt install build-essential libreadline-dev

Alpine Linux:

    apk add libc-dev gcc readline-dev

Oils has been tested on several Linux distros and OS X.  It aims to run on any
POSIX system.  If it doesn't, file a bug here:

Build Options
-------------

./configure --help will show the options.  Right now, the only significant
options are --prefix and --{with,without}-readline.

Notes
-----

- The oils-for-unix executable behaves like busybox, and osh is a symlink to
  it.
